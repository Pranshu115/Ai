# Backorder Prediction CLI & Healthcare Test Prediction

## Backorder Prediction CLI

### Overview
The **Backorder Prediction CLI** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to predict whether a product will go on backorder using machine learning models built with PyTorch. The project is containerized using Docker and deployed via `docker-compose`.

### Features
- Accepts product data as input
- Runs predictions using a trained PyTorch model
- Outputs the likelihood of backorder
- Containerized with Docker
- Easily deployable with `docker-compose`

### Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Docker & Docker Compose

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd backorder-prediction-cli
   ```
2. Build the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```
3. Run the CLI:
   ```sh
   docker-compose run backorder-cli --help
   ```

### Usage
Run the CLI with the necessary arguments:
```sh
docker-compose run backorder-cli --input data.csv
```
Example output:
```sh
Product ID: 12345
Backorder Probability: 0.85
Status: Likely to be backordered
```

## Healthcare Test Prediction

### Overview
The **Healthcare Test Prediction** system predicts medical test outcomes using machine learning. The model is trained on healthcare datasets and can assist in early diagnostics.

### Features
- Accepts patient test data as input
- Predicts medical test results
- Provides probability scores for different conditions

### Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Required dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd healthcare-test-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run predictions:
   ```sh
   python predict.py --input patient_data.csv
   ```

### Usage
Run the script with patient test data:
```sh
python predict.py --input patient_data.csv
```
Example output:
```sh
Patient ID: 56789
Disease Probability: 0.72
Diagnosis: Possible risk, further tests recommended
Test Result: Normal/Abnormal
```
